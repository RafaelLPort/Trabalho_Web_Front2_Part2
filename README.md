# Rick and Morty Characters - React App

## Project

This project is a React application that consumes the public **Rick and Morty** API to display characters from the show in the form of cards. The page allows filtering characters by name and exploring an infinite list, which loads more characters as the user scrolls down.

## Features

- **Character Listing**: Displays characters from the Rick and Morty series with their name, image, and other relevant information.
- **Search Filter**: Allows searching for characters by name, dynamically updating the list as the user types.
- **Infinite Scrolling**: More characters are automatically loaded as the user scrolls down the page.
- **Detailed Modal**: Clicking on a character card opens a modal with additional details about the character.
- **Loading Spinner**: A green spinner (#7FFF00) is displayed while the data is loading.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **Axios**: Used to make HTTP requests to the Rick and Morty API.
- **CSS/Styled-components**: Used for styling the components.
- **React Infinite Scroller**: For implementing infinite scrolling for the character list.
- **React Modal**: To display character details in a modal window.
